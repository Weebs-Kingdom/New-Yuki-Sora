# How to contribute?

If you want to contribute to this project, you can fork it, make your changes, test it and create a pull request with a
description of what you added. I'll take time to read, what you've done and confirm or write you a comment.

I'll add a desciption on how you start your coding in Yuki-Sora, where all the classes are locaded and what my "util
classes" are.

# Do I want help
